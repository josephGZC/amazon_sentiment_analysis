# Amazon Sales Sentiment Analysis

## Project Background
Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, offers a vast selection of products across categories such as electronics, home goods, and office supplies. This **sentiment analysis**, based on **January 2023** internal sales and review data, examines customer sentiment trends, identifies product quality concerns, and assesses sentiment correlations with price, discounts, and review volume. The findings guide ranking adjustments, quality control measures, and policy improvements to optimize marketplace efficiency.

## Executive Summary

This project analyzed **Amazon sales data and customer sentiment** across various product categories using a VADER-based approach, revealing an **average sentiment score of 0.813 ± 0.377**, with **72% of products classified as positive**. A Pearson correlation analysis (r = 0.12) indicated that customer sentiment is weakly related to price, emphasizing the importance of product quality and user experience. Certain subcategories, such as **battery chargers (electronics)** and **exhaust fans (home & kitchen)**, showed negative sentiment, highlighting the need for **stricter quality control**. Separating products by review volume (≥20k vs. <20k reviews) identified under-marketed but high-quality items, including **webcams, power LAN adapters, and tripods**, which could benefit from **targeted promotions**. To enhance customer satisfaction and marketplace efficiency, **search ranking algorithms** should prioritize well-rated yet under-marketed products (e.g., Philips GC1905 Steam Iron and Mi 108 cm Full HD Android LED TV) while enforcing **stricter quality measures** for consistently low-rated items (e.g., ENVIE ECR-20 Battery Charger and Fire-Boltt Ninja Calling Smartwatch). Additionally, **policy refinements** should address recurring complaints in low-scoring subcategories, such as streaming clients and data dongles.
